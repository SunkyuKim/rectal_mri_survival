Some weights of the model checkpoint at vocab/kexin_clinicalbert/pretraining were not used when initializing VisitBertCox: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing VisitBertCox from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPretraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing VisitBertCox from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of VisitBertCox were not initialized from the model checkpoint at vocab/kexin_clinicalbert/pretraining and are newly initialized: ['gru.weight_ih', 'gru.weight_hh', 'gru.bias_ih', 'gru.bias_hh', 'attn1.weight', 'attn1.bias', 'attn2.weight', 'attn2.bias', 'context_bn.weight', 'context_bn.bias', 'context_bn.running_mean', 'context_bn.running_var', 'demo.weight', 'demo.bias', 'demo_bn.weight', 'demo_bn.bias', 'demo_bn.running_mean', 'demo_bn.running_var', 'fc.weight', 'fc.bias', 'submulnn.0.weight', 'submulnn.0.bias', 'submulnn.2.weight', 'submulnn.2.bias', 'submulnn.4.weight', 'submulnn.4.bias', 'final.weight', 'final.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at vocab/kexin_clinicalbert/pretraining were not used when initializing VisitBertCox: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing VisitBertCox from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPretraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing VisitBertCox from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of VisitBertCox were not initialized from the model checkpoint at vocab/kexin_clinicalbert/pretraining and are newly initialized: ['gru.weight_ih', 'gru.weight_hh', 'gru.bias_ih', 'gru.bias_hh', 'attn1.weight', 'attn1.bias', 'attn2.weight', 'attn2.bias', 'context_bn.weight', 'context_bn.bias', 'context_bn.running_mean', 'context_bn.running_var', 'demo.weight', 'demo.bias', 'demo_bn.weight', 'demo_bn.bias', 'demo_bn.running_mean', 'demo_bn.running_var', 'fc.weight', 'fc.bias', 'submulnn.0.weight', 'submulnn.0.bias', 'submulnn.2.weight', 'submulnn.2.bias', 'submulnn.4.weight', 'submulnn.4.bias', 'final.weight', 'final.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
